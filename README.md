## GreyBook

This is **a CS2103T Software Engineering project by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* Get to know more [about us](docs/AboutUs.md) !
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _GreyBook_).
* Motivation: We **love** NUS Greyhats and we want to make a desktop application used for commitee members of clubs and societies (specifically Greyhats) who prefer CLI-like applications for club management!
* Codebase is written in OOP fashion.
* GUI is created with JavaFX.
* Comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
